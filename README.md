# Employee Management CRUD
CRUD employee management application

This project is a simple CRUD application built with HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), Font Awesome and JavaScript. It features an employee management form where admins can add, update, delete, and search for employees. The form includes input fields for name, age, salary, and currency, with real-time validation using regex to ensure proper data entry. Employee data is displayed in a table, and a search function allows for real-time filtering. All data is stored in localStorage to persist between sessions.
